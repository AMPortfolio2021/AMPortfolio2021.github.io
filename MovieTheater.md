The Movie Theater app is a user-friendly and comprehensive mobile application designed to enhance the moviegoing
experience. It offers a seamless and convenient platform for users to browse the latest movie listings, view showtimes,
and purchase tickets effortlessly. With its intuitive interface, users can explore detailed movie information, watch
trailers, and read reviews to make informed choices. The app also features a user-friendly seat selection and booking
system, allowing patrons to reserve their preferred seats. Additionally, it provides real-time updates on upcoming
releases, special promotions, and exclusive deals, making it the ultimate companion for movie enthusiasts, ensuring they
have an enjoyable and stress-free cinematic experience.

I was asked to design a user-friendly application for the users to make the process of booking, buying, and paying
easier. They were looking for an understandable process for the users since most of their clients are non-native
speakers. That's what I did.

    <h2>DISCOVER</h2>
</div>

Instead of skipping some steps and jumping to ideation and developing the prototype, I focus on the design process and
have a methodical approach.

### User Interview

In the discovery stage, I conducted some qualitative research, which means I focus on understanding the clients, asking
broad questions, interviewing moviegoers, looking for user challenges, and identifying what they do that I don't know. I
also conducted comparative analysis.

##### Qualitative Research - Interview 5 Users

| Positive                         | Negative                                                    |
|----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| See all movies in one place      | Can't find their favourite movie easily                     |
| Be able to see people's comments | Can't be aware if there is any movie in their mother tongue |
|                                  | Can't pay later                                             |
|                                  | Can't filter their favourite genre                          |
|                                  | No feature for a second-user                                |

##### Takeaways:

These findings show

- The users are busy and need to browse and book their ticket very fast.
- The users are interested in seeing movies in their mother tongue.
- The users would like to have an option to pay later.
- The second-users want to have more options from the app.

### Competitive Analysis

To identify potential areas for improvement, I conducted a competitive analysis of 4 prominent movie theater
applications before beginning the design phase. By taking screenshots and noting common features, I was able to observe
how competitors solve similar problems. By interacting with the application, I also evaluated potential areas for
improvement and feature changes.

    <h2>DEFINE / ANALYSIS</h2>
</div>

After my research was completed, I came up with a lot of valuable data and I discovered many problems. The next step in
my design process is to analyze the data and define the best solution for the users. I define **Persona** and **Affinity
Mapping**.

##### Ideation

I start brainstorming and ideating.

| Ideas to consider                    | Ideas to ignore                         |
|--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| Pay later                            | Smart account/ profile                  |
| Filtering option                     | Compare movies                          |
| Feature for second-user & track them | User can send gift card through the app |
| Easily search for a movie            | Offers and promotions                   |
| Easily book the movie and pay        |                                         |
| Add food & beverage                  |                                         |
| People's comment & review            |                                         |

##### Personas

![Alt Text](../assets/img/persona1.jpeg)

Anita is 41 years old who lives in Barcelona. She is a salesperson, and she doesn’t have time to brows on the internet
during the week. In her free time, she would like to go to the movie theater, but she doesn’t like to look for her
favorite genre for hours. She prefers being notified when her favourite movie is on the movie theater.

![Alt Text](../assets/img/persona2.jpeg)

Bruno is 25 years old who lives in Alicante with his dog. He is a bookkeeper, and he doesn’t know English well. In his
free time, he would like to go to the movie theater to see a movie in his mother tongue.

<div class="warning" style='background-color:#798DC5; text-align:center;'>
    <h2>DEVELOP</h2>
</div>

##### According to what Anita & Bruno want

I develop my idea to start my design process. For developing the idea I considered a scenario to respond to my persona's
needs, and I conducted the user flow to show their journey through browsing the website, booking and buying their
ticket.

##### User's Needs

- Save time when booking and buying the ticket online
- Find movies in different language
- See people's reviews and comments
- Browse, book, and buy a ticket easily
- Pay later option

##### Solution

- Provide filtering option for users to browse, book, and buy tickets easily
- Have the feature to select their favourite movie in different languages
- Have a chance to see people's reviews and comments
- Have a pay later option

##### Scenario & Flow Diagram

##### Scenarios

Anita likes to search and buy her ticket fast and easy. She goes to the app and goes to the home page. She filters to
see her favourite movie and theater, and then selects her favourite movie and theater. She goes to the payment method
and receive the confirmation through her email or phone.
When she goes to the app for the second time, the app offers her favourite genre and theater. Everything is by default
so she doesn't need to add her payment method again.

Anita needs an app that allows her to filter her favorite genre and she needs to be notified of her favorite genre/
movie via email/phone to have an opportunity to buy the ticket online sooner.
If Anita signs up in the app, then she can utilize the filtering option to view only her favorite genre movies.
We believe that filtering option for Anita will allow her to find the favourite genre and buy the ticket online.

Bruno wants to be able to filter the movies in his mother tongue. He goes to the app and filter the movies in German so
he can see the list of the movies. Then, he selects his movie and theater. He can also see people's review about
different movies and theater to have a better choice. After selecting his movie, he goes to the payment method or he can
choose the Pay later option.

Mid-Fidelity Prototype

    <h2>DELIVER</h2>
</div> 

##### Interactive Prototype

##### Search and filter for the first-time users

First-time users can select where they are located, then the app offers them the movie and the movie theater near to
them.

If the user doesn't select location, they can enter the filters to look for their favorite movies and also their
favourite language.

![Alt Text](../assets/img/users-select-location.gif)           ![Alt Text](../assets/img/users-doesn_t-select-location.gif)

##### Book and Pay for the movie

To help the user to find their favourite genre, I structured the filter option. By that, they can filter based on their
favourite genre, actor, and place. They can also easily buy their ticket. After selecting a movie and their seat, the
payment method is by default for the second-time user but they can change it.

![Alt Text](../assets/img/book-and-pay.gif)

##### Second-time users

First of all, when the user opens the app, they can see their favorite movie genre, language, and their favorite movie
theater. They can select their favorite movie, or they can update their filtering option. So, the app has everything by
default for the second-time user.

The other way to nurture the second-time user is by receiving a pop-up message on their phone about their favorite movie
when it is on their favorite movie theater. So, they directed to the app, and they can purchase their ticket less than 3
mins as everything is by default, but they have a chance to update it. Their favourite snack is also by default.

##### Pay later

The user can select the 'Pay later' option.

![Alt Text](../assets/img/pay-later.gif)

##### Add food and beverage

Food & beverages is added to the buying process to give a chance to the user to have everything ready when they get to
the movie theater.

![Alt Text](../assets/img/Add-food-and-beverage.gif)

### Review & comments

The other option that this app offers is giving the user the reviews of the movies and movie theater. By that, the users
can see the others comments to help them to decide easier.

### Sign up profile

If the user sign up in the profile, they can have different options such as offers and gift cards.
