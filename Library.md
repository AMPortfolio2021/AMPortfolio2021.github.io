My library website design is a sophisticated and user-friendly digital hub meticulously engineered to facilitate easy
access to a wealth of knowledge and resources. It showcases a clean and intuitive user interface, enabling visitors to
seamlessly explore an extensive catalog of books, articles, multimedia, and research materials. The website prioritizes
efficient search and retrieval through advanced search filters and organized categorization. It offers interactive
features such as online reservations, renewal options, and a user-friendly account management system. Furthermore, it
serves as a dynamic platform for community engagement, promoting library events, workshops, and discussions. With its
user-centric approach, seamless accessibility, and commitment to fostering knowledge and community, your library website
design sets a benchmark for modern library services.

The city hall in Barcelona asked me to redesign the Juan Marse library website in order to make it easier for the users to reserve their books and they can also be aware of the upcoming release. That's what I did.

##### Business Analysis
Research has shown that most of the libraries in Barcelona don't have the feature of reserving books and they don't let you reserve any book. The upcoming release are no clear in the website.
So, Juan Marse library revolutionary design provides reserving book feature for users and also makes the upcoming releases visible in the design.

### Heuristic Evaluation

##### Usability Testing ( Usability Huristics)

##### Current state analysis
To develop a concrete roadmap to address the pain points, we understood the complexities that form the current state.

##### Finding: ( Analysis Heuristics)

![Alt Text](../assets/img/Bibloteca1.jpg)

##### Previous website
Observations:
- Juan Marse logo is not present.
- Navigation terms are not user-focused.
- It's unclear where users can see upcoming releases.
- Not clear if users can reserve the book or not.
- No filtering feature can be seen.
- Not clear if the user can have have a personal profile or not.

The current website as you can see has many problems. The website has a very poor structure and is completely disorganized.

##### What can we do?
After discussions, we concluded that we need to make a complete website redesign. We outlined our client's ultimate goal and developed an approach plan to make steps toward meeting her goal. Our approach plan is to oriented to develop the user-friendly website.

##### Previous website
We concluded:
A total redesign of the website is needed to establish a user-friendly website.

Approach Plan:
Analyze other libraries to:
- Develop user-friendly experience
- Provide a feature to reserve a book
- Make the upcoming releases visible on the navigation
- Provide a profile feature

### Online Survey & Major Outcomes
To set the research in the right direction our next step was to craft an online survey to research the experience of our possible users, discover their needs and unpack the insights.
There were a total of 20 questions. We received a total of 248 responses. We followed up with 11 participants.
Some questions are as follows:
- What's your age?
- How many hours do you read book every week?
- How often do you go to the library?
- What are you looking for more when going to the library website?
- Can you tell us why do you go to the library or library website?
- How much on average do you spend on a library website?
- Do you usually reserve book from the library online or in the library?
- When was the last time you feel discomfort on a library website? What was the reason?

### Contextual Research
My Observation
Most people that go to the library website:
- The 20s, 30s, and 40s age group
- Mostly students and employed
- Love reading
- Educated

So I decided that my personas are educated people that love reading a love. They are comfortable to use technology and they don't mind browsing on the library website.

### Competitive Analysis
I conducted thorough research of potential competitors and discovered some libraries are comparable to our goals.

Biblioteca de la Universidad Pompeu Fabra is their biggest competitors.
Also investigated UPC university library,

<div class="warning" style='background-color:#798DC5; text-align:center;'>
    <h2>Research</h2>
</div>

I asked several questions from different users to see what problems they face when they look at the library website.
One of my personas, Lola, says: "I wish the library made it easier for me to access all the newest mystery releases"
She wants to "drop by the library in the late afternoon to look for new books to check out after school is finished the
day"
So reserving a book is a feature she is looking for on the library website.

Another perosna, Javier, says: " I love mystery novels, but I have a hard time finding new releases on the website. It
would be nice if there was a place for new book releases."
He didn't have any problem to go to the library but he would like to be informed about new book releases.
So letting the members know about new release takes into consideration.

### Pain points

Lola's pain points
She Can't access the library outside of operating hours and can only check out books from the library in person. She
also wants to know when unavailable books will be available. She also wants to have multiple filtering option when
searching for books.

Oscar's pain points
He can't access the new releases on the library website. He believes new release books get lost in other book.

### Competitive analysis

I evaluate the quality of competitors' product such as their strengths and weaknesses. I could see that most of the
libraries in Barcelona don't have the reservation option. There is not any possiblities to inform the members of the
latest release either.

### What problem I solved

- Ability to select multiple filters at once
- Shopping cart full of books to check out
- Add 'Basket' button
- Provide a date range for expected availability
- Add new release option

Family situation: Married
Occupation: Developer

Goals:
Reserve books on her schedule and have books she want to read available when she arrives at the Library.

Frustration
Lola has to rearrange their busy schedule to reach the library in time to check out books before it closes. And when
Lola arrives at the library, books are often unavailable.

Lola is a developer. She works 40 hours a week in an office. She loves to read at night before going to bed. She is
living in a small studio so she has no space to buy books.

Goals:
Have option to see new release books to reserve them.

Frustration:
Javier has to look for new release on the website for hours and that makes him so angry and frustrated since most of the
time he can't even find what he was lookng for.

Javier has a very busy schedule. He is book lover but he doesn't have time to spend hours for looking for new releases.

### Low fidelity prototype

![Alt Text](../assets/img/wireframe.jpeg)

### Conduct a usability study

I iterviewd 5 participants and tested the low-fidelity prototype. In general, the website was easy to follow and they
could complete the tasks. However, two of them lost the Reserve button so I chnaged the color to make it more visible to
them.
I also added the View more option

Analysis the data
