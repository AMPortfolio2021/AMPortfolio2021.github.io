		<h3 id="what-is-juan-marse-library">What is Juan Marse Library?</h3>
<p><strong>Joan Marse</strong> library wants to have a sophisticated and user-friendly digital hub meticulously engineered to facilitate easy
access to a wealth of knowledge and resources. It wants to showcase a clean and intuitive user interface, enabling visitors to
seamlessly explore an extensive catalog of books, articles, multimedia, and research materials. The website wants to prioritize
efficient search and retrieval through advanced search filters and organized categorization. It would like to offer interactive
features such as online reservations, renewal options, and a user-friendly account management system. Furthermore, it
serves as a dynamic platform for community engagement, promoting library events, workshops, and discussions. With its
user-centric approach, seamless accessibility, and commitment to fostering knowledge and community, your library website
design sets a benchmark for modern library services.</p>

<p>The city hall in Barcelona asked me to redesign the Juan Marse library website in order to provide a better user-friendly experience for the users. That’s what I did.</p>

    <h2>DISCOVER</h2>
</div>

<h3 id="business-analysis">Business Analysis</h3>
<p>Research has shown that most of the libraries in Barcelona don’t have the feature of reserving books and they don’t let you reserve any book. The users can’t find the upcoming releases easily in the page either. The research also shows that librarians have a stressful job since they can’t prepare the books for the clients in advance so the clients are complaining a lot for waiting so much time in a line. Another complaint comes from the users who don’t know when their favourite book is available. Besides that, the clients don’t return their books on time. Many libraries are losing their clients for the mentioned reasons.
So, Juan Marse library revolutionary design provides many new features in its website such as reserving a book capability, upcoming releases section, having an account for librarian, and etc.</p>

<h3 id="heuristic-evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h3>

<h4 id="usability-testing--usability-huristics">Usability Testing ( Usability Huristics)</h4>

<h5 id="current-state-analysis">Current state analysis</h5>
<p>To develop a concrete roadmap to address the pain points, we understood the complexities that form the current state.</p>

<h5 id="finding--analysis-heuristics">Finding: ( Analysis Heuristics)</h5>

<p><img src="../assets/img/Bibloteca1.jpg" alt="Alt Text" /></p>

<h5 id="previous-website">Previous website</h5>
<p>Observations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Juan Marse logo is not present.</li>
  <li>Navigation terms are not user-focused.</li>
  <li>It’s unclear where users can see upcoming releases.</li>
  <li>Not clear if users can reserve the book or not.</li>
  <li>No filtering feature can be seen.</li>
  <li>Not clear if the user can have have a personal profile or not.</li>
  <li>Not clear where librarians can log in to their accounts.</li>
  <li>Not clear when the unavailable book is available.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current website as you can see has many problems. The website has a very poor structure and is completely disorganized.</p>

<h5 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h5>
<p>After discussions, we concluded that we need to make a complete website redesign. We outlined our client’s ultimate goal and developed an approach plan to make steps toward meeting her goal. Our approach plan is to oriented to develop the user-friendly website.</p>

<h5 id="previous-website-1">Previous website</h5>
<p>We concluded:</p>

<p>A total redesign of the website is needed to establish a user-friendly website.</p>

<p>Approach Plan is to nalyze other libraries to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Develop user-friendly experience</li>
  <li>Provide a feature to reserve a book</li>
  <li>Make the upcoming releases visible on the navigation</li>
  <li>Provide an account feature for librarians</li>
  <li>Provide filtering option</li>
  <li>Provide a capability for adding and seeing reviews of other readers</li>
  <li>Provide a notification button when unavailable book is available</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="online-survey--major-outcomes">Online Survey &amp; Major Outcomes</h3>
<p>To set the research in the right direction, our next step was to craft an online survey to research the experience of our possible users, discover their needs and unpack the insights.
There were a total of 20 questions. We received a total of 248 responses. We followed up with 11 participants.
Some questions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What’s your age?</li>
  <li>How many hours do you read book every week?</li>
  <li>How often do you go to the library?</li>
  <li>What are you looking for more when going to the library website?</li>
  <li>Can you tell us why do you go to the library or library website?</li>
  <li>How much on average do you spend on a library website?</li>
  <li>Do you usually reserve book from the library online or in the library?</li>
  <li>When was the last time you feel discomfort on a library website? What was the reason?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contextual-research">Contextual Research</h3>

<p>My Observation is that most people that go to the library website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The 20s, 30s, and 40s age group</li>
  <li>Mostly students and employed</li>
  <li>Love reading</li>
  <li>Educated</li>
</ul>

<p>So I decided that my personas are educated people that love reading a love. They are comfortable to use technology and they don’t mind browsing on the library website.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/Juan-marse1.jpeg" alt="Alt Text" /></p>

<h3 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>I conducted thorough research of potential competitors and discovered some libraries are comparable to our goals.</p>

<p>Biblioteca de la Universidad Pompeu Fabra (UPF) is their biggest competitors.
Also investigated UPC university library, Joan Miro library, and Sagrada Familia library.
I evaluated the quality of competitors’ product such as their strengths and weaknesses. I could see that most of the
libraries in Barcelona don’t have the reservation option. There is not any possiblities to inform the members of the
latest release either.</p>

<p>I also conducted analyses of competitive websites. Obviously, I knew our website lacks many features. But, I learned what features our potential competitors are providing on their websites.</p>

<p>For creating our persona and see what are our pain points and our potential solutions, we conducted affinity mapping.</p>

<p>For creating our persona and see what are pain points and our potential solutions, I conducted affinity mapping.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/affinitymapping.jpg" alt="Alt Text" /></p>

<p>The outcome for Affinity Mapping</p>
<ul>
  <li>I found out reserving a book feature is the major pain point of our website.</li>
  <li>Lack of review and comments from other readers is another major pain point.</li>
  <li>Lack of ‘New releases’ section in the navigation is another pain point.</li>
  <li>No filtering option is another problem.</li>
  <li>Librarians need more info about reserving and returning books.</li>
  <li>Lack of notification for users to know when unavailable book is available and also when returns the served books.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="user-quotes">User Quotes</h5>

<p>I asked several questions from different users to see what problems they face when they look at the library website.</p>
